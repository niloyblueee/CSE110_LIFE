#Suppose, you are given an MÃ—N array called A. Your task is to subtract the row and column numbers and find the absolute difference.
#  Next, find the remainder (rounded to 2 decimal places) by dividing the absolute value by M. Now, 
#If remainder = 0, then find the average of the 1st row. 
#If remainder = 1, then find the average of the 2nd row. 
#If remainder = 2, then find the average of the 3rd row. 
#Similarly, if remainder = m-1, then find the average of the mth row. 
#Now multiply each element of the original array with the average to find out the final array.
#  Finally, display the new array.
